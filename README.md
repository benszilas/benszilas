# ðŸš€ My Software Engineering Journey  

Back in 2024, I decided to learn **software engineering** to become an active participant in our digitalized world.  
I currently study at **42 Vienna**, a peer-driven software engineering school with a unique hands-on learning approach.  

At **42**, we donâ€™t have traditional lectures, teachers, or structured courses. Instead, we learn by solving real-world challenges, collaborating with peers, and defending our code. The learning experience is much like open-source developmentâ€”**we review each otherâ€™s code, share knowledge, and push each other to higher standards.**  

## ðŸ”¹ What I Learned at 42 Vienna  
### ðŸ’» **Technical Skills**  
- **Systems Programming**: Writing low-level C/C++ programs from scratch.  
  - Rebuilding **Unix functions** like `printf` (no library shortcuts!).  
  - Creating a **Bash shell**, including environment handling, forking, piping, parsing, and signal handling.  
  - Implementing an **HTTP server** by rebuilding `nginx`.  
- **DevOps & CI/CD**:  
  - Automated testing and deployment with **GitHub Actions**.  
  - Debugging with tools like **Valgrind and Helgrind** to ensure memory safety.  
- **High-Quality Code**: Every project must be **100% correct**â€”no "close enough" solutions.  

### ðŸ§  **Soft Skills**  
- **Problem-Solving & Self-Learning**:  
  - No handholdingâ€”when given a project, we receive **a PDF and a "Good luck!"**  
  - Learn to embrace "I have no idea how to do this" and find solutions independently.  
- **Code Reviews & Defenses**:  
  - After submitting a project, I must **defend every part of my code** to three random peers.  
  - If I canâ€™t explain my code or justify my decisions, I fail.  
  - This process teaches **clear communication, conflict resolution, and resilience**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Featured School Projects  

- **Minishell**
  - Creating a **Bash shell**, including environment handling, forking, piping, parsing, and signal handling.  
- **MiniRT**
  - A raytracing renderer capable of rendering basic geometric shapes, point lights and ambient lighting,
  - ppm textures and bump maps, perfect mirrors, enhanced with anti-aliasing
  - editor features: translation/rotation, RGB color adjustment, adding objects, in-editor file explorer
  - open/save scene, keyboard and mouse event handlers for an interactive experience
